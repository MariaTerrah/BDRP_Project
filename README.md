 In order to try the code in a specific document the document should be added to the data folder and path to the document should be updated on the code.

:small_blue_diamond: After creating the dataset the model can be trained and saved using 'MaskClassification.ipynb' on Train_Model folder.


:small_blue_diamond: The model trained is loaded to run 'VideoStream.py' (on Use_Model folder) for face mask detection on webcam video stream.

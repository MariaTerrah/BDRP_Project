# Text Extraction from Geological Documents Project
 
 This project is an implementation of a system for retrieving textual data from PDF documents. It was built with Tesseract , openCV , TextBlob and Spark.
 
 In order to run the code in a specific document the document should be added to the data folder and path to the document should be updated on the code.

:small_blue_diamond: Table_detect.py implements the table detection. (1) 

:small_blue_diamond: image-preprocessing.py implements the image preprocessing of the pages of documents. (2)

:small_blue_diamond: spelling_correction.py implements the text/spelling correction. (3)

:small_blue_diamond: Topic_modelling.py implements the topic analysis. (4)

It is possible to run each module separately by following the order of the architecture (1) , (2) , (3) and (4).

To run the whole code containing all the above modules , run Geological_doc_extraction.py
